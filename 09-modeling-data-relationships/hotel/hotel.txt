Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries applying the following scenarios:

Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
SELECT guests.first_name, guests.last_name
FROM guests
LEFT OUTER JOIN bookings
ON guests.guest_id = bookings.guest_id
WHERE bookings.guest_id IS NULL;

Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.

SELECT g.first_name, g.last_name, COUNT (b.booking_id) AS number_of_rooms, b.check_in_date, b.check_out_date
FROM bookings AS b
JOIN guests AS g
ON g.guest_id = b.guest_id
GROUP BY g.guest_id, b.check_in_date, b.check_out_date
HAVING COUNT (b.booking_id) > 1;


Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.

SELECT g.first_name, g.last_name, r.room_number, COUNT (b.booking_id) AS number_of_bookings
FROM bookings AS b
JOIN guests AS g
ON g.guest_id = b.guest_id
JOIN rooms AS r
ON r.room_number = b.room_number
GROUP BY g.guest_id, r.room_number
HAVING COUNT (b.booking_id) > 1;


Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
SELECT r.room_number, COUNT (DISTINCT b.guest_id) AS unique_guests
FROM bookings AS b
JOIN rooms AS r
ON r.room_number = b.room_number
GROUP BY r.room_number
HAVING COUNT (DISTINCT b.guest_id) > 1;
